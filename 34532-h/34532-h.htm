<h2>A Synopsis of the American Bats<br>
of the Genus Pipistrellus</h2>

<h3>By</h3>

<h3>E. RAYMOND HALL AND WALTER W. DALQUEST</h3>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four nominal species of the genus <i>Pipistrellus</i> are currently recognized
in North America. They are <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a> (F. Cuvier)
of eastern North America, <a href="#piphes"><i>Pipistrellus hesperus</i></a> (H. Allen) of western
North America, <a href="#pipsubver"><i>Pipistrellus veracrucis</i></a> (Ward) from Veracruz,
Mexico, and <a href="#pipcin"><i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i></a> Miller from Tabasco, Mexico.</p>

<p>In the past three years, specimens have been obtained in Veracruz
(by Dalquest) of each of the southern species. One of these, <i>P.
cinnamomeus</i>, previously was known from a single specimen; the
other, <i>P. veracrucis</i>, was known only from six specimens which now
are lost or misplaced. The results of our study of these recently
acquired Mexican specimens constitute our principal contribution in
this paper; we have done little more with the material from the
United States and Canada than to codify the findings of other mammalogists
with respect to the systematic status and geographic distribution.</p>

<p>Study of the available specimens reveals that there are only two
species, <a href="#piphes"><i>Pipistrellus hesperus</i></a> and <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a>; <i>Pipistrellus
veracrucis</i> proves to be only a subspecies (geographic race) of <i>P.
subflavus</i>, and <a name="pipcin"><i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i></a> proves to be a species of
another genus, <i>Myotis</i> (see Hall and Dalquest, page 583 of this
volume).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="center">
Genus <b>Pipistrellus</b> Kaup
</div>

<div class="bkqt">
<p>1829. <i>Pipistrellus</i> Kaup, Skizzirte Entw.-Gesch. u. nat&#252;rl. Syst. europ.
Thierw., Vol. 1, p. 98, Type, <i>Vespertilio pipistrellus</i> Schreber (not seen
by us, after Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:87, 1897).</p>
</div>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Range in the New World.</i>&mdash;In North America from southern Canada to
Honduras (47 degrees to 5 degrees North Latitude) and from the Atlantic to
the Pacific; not recorded from the West Indies or South America.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Size small; tail approximately as long as outstretched leg;
ears well developed with prominent tragus; dental formula: i.<img src="images/frac_23.png" border="0" alt="dental formula 2/2" title="dental formula 2/2" style="height: 1.25em; vertical-align:-0.4em;">; c.<img src="images/frac_11.png" border="0" alt="dental formula 1/1" title="dental formula 1/1" style="height: 1.25em; vertical-align:-0.4em;">; p.<img src="images/frac_22.png" border="0" alt="dental formula 2/2" title="dental formula 2/2" style="height: 1.25em; vertical-align:-0.4em;">; m.<img src="images/frac_33.png" border="0" alt="dental formula 3/3" title="dental formula 3/3" style="height: 1.25em; vertical-align:-0.4em;">;
two upper incisors subequal and outer one lacking a concavity on surface facing
canine; dentition otherwise essentially as in <i>Myotis</i> Kaup except that third
premolar is always, instead of rarely, absent.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;There are two species in North America. Their geographic
ranges, as now known, meet, but do not overlap. Certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
differences between the two species are listed in the parallel columns
below. Most of these differences in the skull and teeth are illustrated
in figures 22 and 23 on page 92 of Miller's "Revision of the North
American bats of the family Vespertilionidae (N. Amer. Fauna, 13,
1897)."</p>

<div class="center">
<b>Pipistrellus hesperus</b><br>
(Synonomy under subspecies)<br>
</div>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Arid Sonoran life-zones of western North America from Washington
southward to Jalisco.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Smoke Gray to Buff Brown (Capitalized color terms after
Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912)
dorsally; total length, 60 to 86; foot less than half as long as tibia; tragus
blunt with terminal part bent forward; skull nearly straight in dorsal profile;
inner upper incisor unicuspidate; outer upper incisor with accessory cusp on
anterointernal face; P1, viewed from occlusal face, less than a seventh of area
of canine, and from labial aspect concealed by canine and fourth premolar;
lower, third premolar lower than anterior cusp of canine; lower premolars
crowded, distance between canine and first molar less than length of second
lower molar.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In the United States and in the northern part of Mexico,
<i>P. hesperus</i> is the smallest bat found. Little is known about its
habits. It emerges earlier in the evening than other species of bats.
The frequency with which it is seen near cliffs suggests that it finds
concealment under rocks. In winter, in Nevada (Hall, Mammals of
Nevada, p. 150, 1946), <i>P. hesperus</i> has been found singly in crevices
in the roofs of mine tunnels.</p>

<p>In the United States National Museum in July, 1949, the specimen
providing the easternmost record station of occurrence was examined
by us. This is No. 23591, in alcohol, taken on August 24, 1890, by
William Lloyd, original No. 88, at the mouth of the Pecos River in
Texas. In the same collection there is a specimen of <i>Pipistrellus
subflavus</i> providing the westernmost record of occurrence of that
species. This specimen, a skin with skull, is No. 126729, &#9794;, taken
on May 3, 1903, by Jas. H. Gaut, original No. 1271, at Comstock,
Texas. The two localities concerned are in the Valley of the Rio
Grande, and are only about five miles apart. Nevertheless, the two
specimens are clearly referable to their respective species and show
no tendency toward intergradation. Consequently, confidence is felt
in treating <a href="#piphes"><i>Pipistrellus hesperus</i></a> and <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a> as two
distinct species.</p>

<p>The most recent report upon geographic variation throughout the
entire species, <a href="#piphes"><i>Pipistrellus hesperus</i></a>, was that by Hatfield (Jour.
Mamm., 17:257-262, August 14, 1936). Later, as explained below
in the account of <a href="#piphesaus"><i>P. h. australis</i></a>, Burt (Miscl. Publ., Mus. Zool.,
Univ. Michigan, 39:25, February 15, 1938) examined specimens from
Sonora, Mexico, and for them and for specimens from southern Arizona
proposed a different nomenclatural arrangement.</p>

some specimens (from Sonora), referred one from northwestern
Sonora to <a href="#pipheshes"><i>P. h. hesperus</i></a> and those from northeastern Sonora to <a href="#piphesmer"><i>P. h.
merriami</i></a>. Since our treatment of subspecies of <i>Pipistrellus</i> (<a href="#pipsubver"><i>P. s.
veracrucis</i></a> excepted) aims merely to reflect the latest systematic
treatment accorded the animals, we would follow Burt (<i>op. cit.</i>)
were it not for the fact that he shows the geographic range of <a href="#piphesmer"><i>P. h.
merriami</i></a> separated by the range of <a href="#pipheshes"><i>P. h. hesperus</i></a> into two parts.
This is inconsistent with the ordinarily accepted concept of subspecies.

a critical study is needed of adequate material of <a href="#piphes"><i>Pipistrellus hesperus</i></a>
of Mexico.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Canadian to Tropical life-zones of eastern North America from
Quebec southward to Honduras.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Sayal Brown to darker than Mummy Brown, dorsally; total
length, 73-89; foot more than half as long as tibia; tragus tapering and straight;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
dorsal profile of skull convex in interorbital region; inner upper incisor bicuspidate;
outer upper incisor unicuspidate (lacking accessory cusp on anterointernal
face); P1 viewed from occlusal face more than a seventh of area of
canine and visible from labial aspect; lower, third premolar as high as anterior
cusp of canine; lower premolars less crowded than in <i>P. hesperus</i> and
distance between canine and first molar less than length of second lower molar.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In winter this species hibernates in caves in clusters
of fewer than fifty individuals, but in summer fewer of the bats live
there and at this season some have been captured as far as thirty
miles from any such retreat suggesting that the bats inhabit other
types of shelter. The wide range of this species in respect to life-zones
is noteworthy; it occurs in the Canadian Life-zone (Joliet,
Quebec), the Tropical Life-zone (30 km. SSE Jes&#250;s Carranza, Veracruz)
and in the intervening life-zones.</p>

<p>The longer thumb of this species, in comparison with that of
<a href="#piphes"><i>Pipistrellus hesperus</i></a>, was verified by measuring the thumb including
its claw and the pad at the base of the thumb in 12 <a href="#pipsubver"><i>P. s. veracrucis</i></a>
and 10 <a href="#piphesmax"><i>P. h. maximus</i></a>. In <i>veracrucis</i> the mean was 5.9 millimeters
and the extremes were 5.5 and 6.4. In <i>maximus</i> the
corresponding figures were 3.9, 3.6 and 4.3.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;No one, as far as we know, has carefully studied the
variation in <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a> of the United States and Canada
since Miller named <i>P. s. obscurus</i>. With the more abundant material
now available, such an appraisal would be worth-while. The
occurrences cited above for Minnesota and Wisconsin were recorded
in the literature under the specific name without indication of subspecific
affinity. The reference of specimens from these states to
the subspecies <i>P. s. obscurus</i> is an arbitrary assignment on our part;
we have not seen them. However, two specimens in the University
of Kansas Museum of Natural History from Potosi (Snake Cave)
Grant County, Wisconsin, are referable to <i>P. s. obscurus</i>. These
provide the southwesternmost record station of occurrence in Wisconsin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
but are not shown on the distribution map because the specimens
were received after <a href="#fig_1">figure 1</a> was prepared.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the species <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a> has not
yet, as far as we can ascertain, been recorded from Michigan, northern
Indiana, northern Illinois, or Iowa. Probably the species occurs
in these areas.</p>

</div>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type locality.</i>&mdash;Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., Veracruz.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Eastern Mexico, certainly from the type locality southward into
Honduras. Records of occurrence are: <i>Veracruz</i>: Las Vigas (13 specimens
from 4 km. E Las Vigas, 8,500 ft., K. U.); 30 km. SSE Jes&#250;s Carranza, 1
(K. U.). <i>Honduras</i>: Jilamo Farm, Tela District, 3 (Univ. Michigan).</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small for the species; measurements of 13 near topotypes
are: total length, 78(73-85); tibia, 12.9(11.8-14.7); forearm, 31.8(29.5-33.1);
greatest length of skull (exclusive of incisors), 12.2(11.8-12.6); breadth of braincase
immediately above roots of zygomatic arches, 6.3(6.0-6.7). Color darker
than Mummy Brown above and below.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The specimen from thirty kilometers south-southeast
of Jes&#250;s Carranza, Veracruz, and the three specimens from Honduras
agree in all respects with topotypes. The color of <i>P. s. veracrucis</i>
is much darker than that of <a href="#pipsubobs"><i>P. s. obscurus</i></a> and is between black and
the darkest brown in Ridgway's (<i>op. cit.</i>) color key. Rinker (Jour.
Mamm., 29:179-180,1948) described the three specimens from Honduras
without assigning a specific name to them because he lacked
topotypes of <i>P. s. veracrucis</i>. We find nothing in his description to
correct, but can add that the upper tooth-rows in many, but not in
all, specimens of <i>P. s. veracrucis</i> are straighter than in <a href="#pipsubsub"><i>P. s. subflavus</i></a>.
Probably it was this feature to which Rinker referred when
he said that in <i>veracrucis</i> "The tooth rows tend to be more convergent
posteriorly." Rinker did not refer the three specimens from
Honduras to <i>P. veracrucis</i> because Ward's original description states
that <i>veracrucis</i> has evenly spaced lower incisors and a basal cusp
on the lower canine on only its forward edge. Rinker's specimens
from Honduras have the first incisors in contact with each other,
the second incisors in contact with the first incisors and the third
incisor on each side of the lower jaw separated by a space from the
second incisor and from the canine. The specimens from Honduras
have a basal cusp on the hinder edge of the lower canine. In these
two features they agree with the specimens from Veracruz and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
specimens of <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a> from the United States and Canada.
It is clear that Ward (Amer. Nat., 25:747,1891) was mistaken
in stating that the lower incisors of <i>veracrucis</i> were evenly spaced
and that the canine had a basal cusp on only the forward edge.
Ward (<i>loc. cit.</i>) was correct in regarding his <i>Vesperugo veracrucis</i>
as "most closely related to <i>V. georgianus</i> [= <i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i>],"
but for want of actual specimens of <i>P. subflavus</i> to use in comparison
was incorrect in supposing that <a href="#pipsub"><i>P. subflavus</i></a> had only two bands
of color on the fur, more hair on the legs, and a larger area of hair
on the interfemoral membrane. In these respects we perceive no
difference between specimens from Veracruz and the United States.</p>

<p><i>Vesperugo veracrucis</i> Ward, therefore, proves to be only a subspecies
of <a href="#pipsub"><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i></a>, but is well characterized by dark
color and small size.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
